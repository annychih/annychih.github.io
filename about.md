Hello and Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me!

My name is Anny and I'm a Masters of Data Science candidate at UBC. I put together this little webpage on Github for an assignment, which might answer your question about why it's here and not at [annychih.com](http://annychih.com) (if you were wondering). 

My background includes an undergrad in Marketing and Entrepreneurship from SFU, heaps of media analytics and market research experience in both Canada (Vancouver, BC) and the US (New York, NY), and a good chunk of writing for various newspapers and magazines. 

Now that you know a little about me, I'd love to learn more about you! My email is down below. Feel free to use it! :)

### More Random Information

- I once travelled to Poland on invitation from the Ministry of Economy to attend a recycling conference
- I was once bitten by an emu, and also a donkey!
- I dislike bananas
